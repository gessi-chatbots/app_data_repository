      "reply":"Hello, Brian!\nTaping the \"Start\" button will launch navigation, which always starts from your current location, route calculation starts right after two points are added to navigation. You can try to use \"Plan a route\" to plan routes without location.\nIf you have any other questions please contact us at support@osmand.net"
