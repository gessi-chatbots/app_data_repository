In the free version Widgets and importing events doesn't work. Highly recommending the PRO version, which is great. The only issue I find with both is that there is no Sync option with cloud or desktop app. CalDav for some reason doesn't work for me. Edit: I have the PRO version too. CalDAV won't sync properly without refreshing Google calendar, and was thinking of using personal cloud for syncing, to avoid Google entirely.","CalDAV won't sync properly without refreshing Google calendar, and was thinking of using personal cloud for syncing, to avoid Google entirely.",Sadness
38,Material Notes: Colorful notes,PRODUCTIVITY,30f107f6-8bdf-4815-837c-0da3f7684713,3,Customizable,"I was searching for a clean, simple note-taking app with good widget functionality. This is one of the best that I've found so far. Just a couple of things missing for me: - Ability to add a widget as a new note, instead of having to choose an existing one. - Ability to switch a note to a todo-list after creating it, like with Google Keep - Bulleted/numbered lists (not mandatory but would be nice) - again would be nice to be able to switch an existing note - Customizable font size - Light/pastel background color options with dark text - Ability to set night mode globally instead of just temporarily within a note - Clear placeholder text for the title field - I accidentally started writing my note in that field and then was confused when the Enter key didn't work  Also I experienced the following bug: I edited a note a few times directly from the widget, then I opened the app. At first I was shown the last edited note - then I tapped the back button and was shown the previous version of that note, then tapped back again and saw the version before that, etc. - it took 5 taps to get back to the main screen and it was quite strange to see the old versions of the same note!  On the whole keep up the good work, will gladly update the review to a 5-star if the bugs get worked out and features continue to be enhanced.","- Ability to switch a note to a todo-list after creating it, like with Google Keep - Bulleted/numbered lists (not mandatory but would be nice) - again would be nice to be able to switch an existing note - Customizable font size - Light/pastel background color options with dark text - Ability to set night mode globally instead of just temporarily within a note - Clear placeholder text for the title field - I accidentally started writing my note in that field and then was confused when the Enter key didn't work  Also I experienced the following bug: I edited a note a few times directly from the widget, then I opened the app.",Reject
