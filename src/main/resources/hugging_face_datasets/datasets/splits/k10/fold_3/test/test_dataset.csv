SMS Backup+,TOOLS,00faa31f-1d57-4d11-9bc4-87cd743081fc,2,Email Server,"Yes, app still works if you use a different (non-gmail) email; but CAUTION!!!! I did exactly that. I set up a new, independent account on MY email server specifically for this app to connect to, to backup my phone SMS/call logs, etc. This was literally the only app/client using this email address; and this app of course knows the password for it. So, after a while my dedicated account was being used to send SPAM and my domain and IP because blacklisted until I figured out it was this account being used to log into my server to send the SPAM. The ONLY explanation is that this app's publisher has a way of gathering non-gmail accounts and passwords and either using them or selling them to SPAMMERS. Perhaps this is one reason why Google won't approve them to use gmail accounts. Anyway, BEWARE!! I suggest you do not use this app.","I set up a new, independent account on MY email server specifically for this app to connect to, to backup my phone SMS/call logs, etc.",Trust
Weather Radar Widget,WEATHER,d36a2dde-c745-4710-9044-4e133e7b32f2,2,Radar,"The widget was the best part of this app becuase no one else did it. The widget hasn't worked in years and they can't seem to fix it.

Material Notes: Colorful notes,PRODUCTIVITY,30f107f6-8bdf-4815-837c-0da3f7684713,3,Customizable,"I was searching for a clean, simple note-taking app with good widget functionality. This is one of the best that I've found so far. Just a couple of things missing for me: - Ability to add a widget as a new note, instead of having to choose an existing one. - Ability to switch a note to a todo-list after creating it, like with Google Keep - Bulleted/numbered lists (not mandatory but would be nice) - again would be nice to be able to switch an existing note - Customizable font size - Light/pastel background color options with dark text - Ability to set night mode globally instead of just temporarily within a note - Clear placeholder text for the title field - I accidentally started writing my note in that field and then was confused when the Enter key didn't work  Also I experienced the following bug: I edited a note a few times directly from the widget, then I opened the app. At first I was shown the last edited note - then I tapped the back button and was shown the previous version of that note, then tapped back again and saw the version before that, etc. - it took 5 taps to get back to the main screen and it was quite strange to see the old versions of the same note!  On the whole keep up the good work, will gladly update the review to a 5-star if the bugs get worked out and features continue to be enhanced.","- Ability to switch a note to a todo-list after creating it, like with Google Keep - Bulleted/numbered lists (not mandatory but would be nice) - again would be nice to be able to switch an existing note - Customizable font size - Light/pastel background color options with dark text - Ability to set night mode globally instead of just temporarily within a note - Clear placeholder text for the title field - I accidentally started writing my note in that field and then was confused when the Enter key didn't work  Also I experienced the following bug: I edited a note a few times directly from the widget, then I opened the app.",Reject

Weather Neon,WEATHER,ba137d87-975b-4a9a-af4b-60c3b3bfc34a,0,Clock widget,"My review of this app went from 5 stars down to 3, (which may be too generous), because the widgets will now, quite often, not actually keep the right time, which is kind of important for a clock widget to do! It's like it just gets stuck at some point and I haven't been able to find any reason why. Too bad cuz I really liked all the different widgets there was to choose from.","My review of this app went from 5 stars down to 3, (which may be too generous), because the widgets will now, quite often, not actually keep the right time, which is kind of important for a clock widget to do!",Anger

Simple Calendar,PRODUCTIVITY,31a75842-d8bc-4f2c-b4e9-3affa6397d0e,6,Desktop app,"Not a bad app, but severely limited, compared to the PRO version. In the free version Widgets and importing events doesn't work. Highly recommending the PRO version, which is great. The only issue I find with both is that there is no Sync option with cloud or desktop app. CalDav for some reason doesn't work for me. Edit: I have the PRO version too. CalDAV won't sync properly without refreshing Google calendar, and was thinking of using personal cloud for syncing, to avoid Google entirely.","CalDAV won't sync properly without refreshing Google calendar, and was thinking of using personal cloud for syncing, to avoid Google entirely.",Sadness

Samsung Notes,PRODUCTIVITY,2066008c-eaad-4097-a851-0d693e0750b2,2,Dock,"In general, it would be a great app. I like taking quick notes on my phone, and continue them on my tab or PC. But once you insert a picture, it ""docks"" in its place, and will not adjust if you modify the text before it. This is a ridiculous bug, and completely makes the app not feasable for classes, as I can not freely modify at home what I wrote in the classroom without messing up the note in general.","But once you insert a picture, it ""docks"" in its place, and will not adjust if you modify the text before it.",Sadness
