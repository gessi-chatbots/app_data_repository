Garmin Smartphone Link,TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL,0fdaf50c-268b-483f-9c16-2843d9405cb6,0,Memory usage,One huge problem: memory usage - 12 GB of storage used!!! No reason for that as I rarely use the app and have traveled only locally with it. No way to see what the space is used for nor can it be controlled. Other features seemed to work okay though in my part of the world there aren't many traffic alerts to be found. I may reinstall this app if I use it for travel. Otherwise: DELETE until needed. (Used with a Garmin RV 760.),One huge problem: memory usage - 12 GB of storage used!!!,Anger

Weather Neon,WEATHER,ba137d87-975b-4a9a-af4b-60c3b3bfc34a,0,Clock widget,"My review of this app went from 5 stars down to 3, (which may be too generous), because the widgets will now, quite often, not actually keep the right time, which is kind of important for a clock widget to do! It's like it just gets stuck at some point and I haven't been able to find any reason why. Too bad cuz I really liked all the different widgets there was to choose from.","My review of this app went from 5 stars down to 3, (which may be too generous), because the widgets will now, quite often, not actually keep the right time, which is kind of important for a clock widget to do!",Anger
Gmail,COMMUNICATION,75338f1d-5fec-4822-a4bd-c268aa0dc32c,1,Canned responses,"Terrible job. And you can se from rhe support replies, all you get is some worthless canned response from some mindless wage slave, at best. It's obvious that this app is about generating revenue for goofgle, not about user experience. Having sync issuws should be something goofgle should be all over. Instead, their worthless support responds with basically robo replies and leaves the burden on the user. Time for new management that understands actual support.","And you can se from rhe support replies, all you get is some worthless canned response from some mindless wage slave, at best.",Anger
