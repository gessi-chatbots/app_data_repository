Garmin Smartphone Link,TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL,0fdaf50c-268b-483f-9c16-2843d9405cb6,0,Memory usage,One huge problem: memory usage - 12 GB of storage used!!! No reason for that as I rarely use the app and have traveled only locally with it. No way to see what the space is used for nor can it be controlled. Other features seemed to work okay though in my part of the world there aren't many traffic alerts to be found. I may reinstall this app if I use it for travel. Otherwise: DELETE until needed.

Stopwatch Timer,TOOLS,45f71817-a282-4229-9be2-8fdd4a87c3c7,2,Stopwatch,"Nice timer and stopwatch app. Looks good, works well and is simple to use. Multiple timers can be used simultaneously. I use it mainly for my drawing sessions and in the kitchen. Ads pop up on timer restarts at times but I'm probably going to pay to remove them anyway so I don't care.

Gmail,COMMUNICATION,75338f1d-5fec-4822-a4bd-c268aa0dc32c,1,Canned responses,"Terrible job. And you can se from rhe support replies, all you get is some worthless canned response from some mindless wage slave, at best. It's obvious that this app is about generating revenue for goofgle, not about user experience. Having sync issuws should be something goofgle should be all over. Instead, their worthless support responds with basically robo replies and leaves the burden on the user. Time for new management that understands actual support.","And you can se from rhe support replies, all you get is some worthless canned response from some mindless wage slave, at best.",Anger
