There should be like an emergency button or something when it blocks your phone.

Routing is not very good and with my new phone I can't share (or backup) the bookmarks unless I send them via bt to my old phone. They're not accessible outside the app and automatic bookmark backup doesn't work properly. You can only sign in with google, Facebook or phone number, not with email.
